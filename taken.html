		<h1><i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i> HOW IT ALL STARTED <i class="fa fa-arrow-down" aria-hidden="true"></i></h1>
		<p>IT, what does it mean to me? Well, compared to other things I like, a lot. My name is Jelle Swaelen and my first real piece of technology was my Nintendo Game Boy. I got it around the age of six and that’s when my fascination for technology started. The Nintendo Game Boy is a handheld console that, at the time I got it, was very popular. When I first started a game on the device, I was blown away, just the thought alone of having something portable that had so many different games to play really shocked me. A few years later I had almost started a collection of videogame consoles, because I really liked everything I could do with them. When I got older, I started using the PC a lot more and left the consoles behind. First I didn’t have my own laptop or desktop PC and used the so called “family PC”, which opened a whole new world of technology to me, that being the internet and being able to watch videos on YouTube. So in the early days of me using a PC I mainly visited YouTube and sites to some games that can be played in a web browser.<br></br>Now that I’m seventeen, I see technology as one of the most important things in my life. I use my smartphone and PC daily and I couldn’t imagine a world without. I usually spend at least around 2 hours a day using my PC, that number goes up quite a bit in the weekends, but I don’t only play games. Since I’ve always been interested in IT and everything around it, I chose Immaculata because it was the nearest school offering IT in the 3rd grade. So when I started the 5th year, I felt at home with all the names used in the IT courses, because I knew what most of them meant. Now I spend most of my time on the PC learning new things related to programming and computer hardware and playing games from time to time. What I also enjoy is making websites. It seems simple, but if you put enough time and effort into it, you can make a really nice finished product.<br></br><img src="img/it-autobiography-1.jpg" class="pure-u-1-2"/><img src="img/it-autobiography-2.jpg" class="pure-u-1-2"/><br></br>When I get older I’d love to do a job in IT and maybe even start my own company or work my way up in one that already exists. Everything about IT changes, from the parts inside a phone or computer, to the software that is used to create games or websites. That is what really fascinates me about technology, nothing remains the same forever. Every bit of progress is good, for example publishing something that you’ve been working on for a long time at the right moment and sharing it with the right people, can really get you somewhere. I definitely think there’s a bright future for this sector and I hope that one day I’ll be part of that future and help innovate technology.</p>
